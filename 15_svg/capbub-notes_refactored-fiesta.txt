1:
prediction: when a table cell is clicked, a popup box with its contents will display
notes: behaves as predicted

2:
prediction: when table cell clicked, popup boxes in following order: cell contents, row contents, table contents (i.e. order in which event listeners are added)
notes: behaves as predicted

3:
prediction: same as 2, when the stopPropogation line uncommented, only cell popup
notes: table happens first, because of the "true" argument

4:
prediction: outer to inner popup boxes because of the "true" argument
notes: seems to behave as predicted
however, on further inspection, it just goes from outer to inner, regardless of order
